\[  `# ClassifyDiscord

This is a discord bot that identifies images and tells you what they are.
The bot is running on the laptop and the jetson is running the ai and they communicate over the network.


## The Algorithm

a bot on the computer takes the image, sends it to the nano. The nano identifies it and then sends the answer back to the bot
